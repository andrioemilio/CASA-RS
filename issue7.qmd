# Issue  6 - I'm going to win Mastermind

This week work seemed a tad daunting for me, and whenever I feel overwhelmed I listen to music at any opportunity ( writing this reminds me I need to go for a hearing test too). Anyway, there was a lot of information to take into account regarding machine learning and classification. To be creative and not insert another mind-map, I decided to see if I could be a champion on mastermind with the topic of week 6!

## Applications

There are many different supervised learning applications in google earth engine. Below is an explanation of some and there corresponding cases.

- CART 

Predicts the value of a target variable by analysing other matters. It then constructs a decision tree where each branch represents a decision based on the variables found and each leaf node provides a prediction for the target variable. 

It starts with a training set as the root node, then divides into subsets using the most suitable attribute. This splitting continues until the tree reaches pure subsets or the predetermined maximum number of leaves.

```


LANDFIRE EVC (Existing Vegetation Cover)

This uses classification and regression trees to create layers in google earth engine to create a 'Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tool'. 

Some of the layers created include: Existing Vegetation Canopy Cover (EVC) and Existing Vegetation Type (EVT).


-   Random Forests

Used for classification and regression. It works by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random forests aim to improve upon the prediction accuracy of a single decision tree by reducing overfitting through averaging the results of many trees

IrrMapper is an annual classification of irrigation status in the 11 Western United States made at Landsat scale (i.e., 30 m) using the Random Forest algorithm, covering years 1986 - present. The Iran-wide land cover map was generated by processing Sentinel imager, an object-based Random Forest classification method was trained by a large number of reference samples for 13 classes to generate the Iran-wide land cover map.

```

- Support Vector Machines 

SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. Maximising the margin between the closest data points of different classes (support vectors), which together creates classification boundaries.

The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) 2015 outlines the extent of human settlements globally derived by means of 2014-2015 multitemporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 imagery. Different classification schemes based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are separately applied to the optical and radar temporal features.

What I noticed within searching GEE cases by specific methods for analysis is the widespread use of random forest algorithm. I struggled within this aspect as I head sought information that spoke of the most widespread methods involving SVM & CART too. Nonetheless it showed me that researchers that use GEE must have an underpinning of the knowledge of these classification methods to justify which one is best fit for the analysis that they provide.

## Reflection

What I found when finding these case studies is a multitude of applications using random forests and hardly much using SVM, this I feel makes sense because I found SVM quite confusing to interpret.

A useful thing about these case studies and google earth engine is that I could access the data myself and play around with it. This helped me understand what is going on a tiny bit more but not completely.

As well as this, making the mastermind video was quite fun for me and it really tested my confidence in what is taught in lectures and practical. I often have a blind confidence that I understand everything as soon as it is said, but evidently, I do not.

I had a tidbit of knowledge already on classification from previous CASA modules, and I pondered on the possibility to cross reference some of what I already studied within spatial relationships, i.e. the sentiment of a population towards type of music streamed and see whether this can be implicated within the environmental changes. Spotify has its own python API library so this definitely could be extracted and overlayed within google earth engine. I wonder if nations with more cold weather listen to on average music with a sadder sentiment (I definitely do) and when the weather changes see how this alters sentiment.
