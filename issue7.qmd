# Issue  6 - I'm going to win Mastermind

This week work seemed a tad daunting for me, and whenever I feel overwhelmed I listen to music at any opportunity ( writing this reminds me I need to go for a hearing test too). Anyway, there was a lot of information to take into account regarding machine learning and classification. To be creative and not insert another mind-map, I decided to see if I could be a champion on mastermind with the topic of week 6!

## Application

There are many different supervised learning applications in google earth engine. Below is an explanation of some and there corresponding cases.

-   Random Forests

Used for classification and regression. It works by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random forests aim to improve upon the prediction accuracy of a single decision tree by reducing overfitting through averaging the results of many trees

IrrMapper is an annual classification of irrigation status in the 11 Western United States made at Landsat scale (i.e., 30 m) using the Random Forest algorithm, covering years 1986 - present. The Iran-wide land cover map was generated by processing Sentinel imager, an object-based Random Forest classification method was trained by a large number of reference samples for 13 classes to generate the Iran-wide land cover map.

```

SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. Maximising the margin between the closest data points of different classes (support vectors), which together creates classification boundaries.

```

The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) 2015 outlines the extent of human settlements globally derived by means of 2014-2015 multitemporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 imagery. Different classification schemes based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are separately applied to the optical and radar temporal features.

## Reflection

What I found when finding these case studies is a multitude of applications using random forests and hardly much using SVM, this I feel makes sense because I found SVM quite confusing to interpret.

A useful thing about these case studies and google earth engine is that I could access the data myself and play around with it. This helped me understand what is going on a tiny bit more but not completely.

As well as this, making the mastermind video was quite fun for me and it really tested my confidence in what is taught in lectures and practical. I often have a blind confidence that I understand everything as soon as it is said, but evidently, I do not.
