# Issue 3 Deep in the Andies

This week I had watched society of the snow of the Andean plane crash in 1972 where  a rugby team left stranded in the Andes for 72 days. Somehow, 16 survivors made it out, but not without controversy (how did they stay alive exactly hmmm).  Still this was fresh on my mind when walking into the tutorial on Thursday. So what better way to explore corrections than to applying upon the trail that two of the survivors had to take to finally be rescued. 
 
##  Summary 

## Application 

### Andean Mounatins
After inputting the coordinates of the crash site, I sought to find more information about the terrain using Landsat imagery. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Issue_3/Andes.png')

```
First of all, to view the terrains of what the survivors were faced with in whatever direction they would go, I will merge two landsat raster images. This will provide me with a clear north, south, east and west of the location that the plane crashed. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Issue_3/connecting.png')

```
For this I had used Landsat level 2, which would include the surface reflectance and temperature. 
Looking at the two images from the usgs, I have one landsat 8 and one landsat 9, the temporal differences between the images are shown below. As you can see the images looks different to each other, this shows that time and cloud cover will influenced my analysis if this is not accounted for. As expected, the vegetation in the area of the crash site will be very very sparse. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Issue_3/NDVI.png')

```

Instead, I attempted to utilise NDGI, the glacier index, this did not show me what I was expected, I used the code below to calculate this for Landsat 8. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Issue_3/NDGI.png')

```

texture of the ground would be important to view the challenge of traversing through the Andean mountains. By looking at the GLCM we understand how the area is characterised.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Issue_3/contrast.png')

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics('issue_3/homogeniety.png')

```
 
By changing the original image data into principle components, PCA helps make it easier to see the differences between types of land or geological features, for use of recognition and categorisation. This approach is especially  helpful for making sense of complicated places like mountains such as the Andes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
