# Introduction


 I am a man of many interest sand hobbies but often find myself doing nothing with my time. I dont know how that works either!
 I love to travel, collect vintage instant cameras and spend time with my dog.
 I hope you get a feel of my humour within this learning diary. I took the informalness  very literal and wanted to explore my own interests and apply this to remote sensing   without gatekeeping if they would be the best examples to use. In my working life so far i've found it difficult to cover topics that I find interesting and this was one of the reasons I pursued masters at CASA. 

My initial thought was to frame this diary in a manner like I saw of the punk zines in the movie *shirkers* I even made a front cover. After the realisation that i've never made a zine before I veered away from the idea. But within the first weeks it was roads lead to Sputnik (the name of my zine), it was the first satellite in orbit!
