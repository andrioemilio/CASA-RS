In the none remote sensing centered part of my life l had made a new year’s resolution to practice more Spanish, primarily watching spongebob en Espanol, but let’s see how that resolution goes…\nAs well as this, it seemed that the stars had aligned and every show, piece of music or even media that I saw was about New Orleans. I walked into the seminar on Thursday listening to the song Yellow moon by New Orleans jazz band the Neville brothers. So of course, in this entry I wanted to use what I learnt about remote sensing to explore Louisianna!\nI came out of this week with an overwhelming fear of how to make a concise entry that holds all of the points shown by Spongebob in S01E02 (not edited at all).\n\n\n\n\nOne of my facourite episodes\n\n\n\nAnd then a path was formed! (Shown by Spongebob in S03E44, still, not edited at all.)\n\n\n\n\nAnother of my facourite episodes\n\n\n\nSo what is remote sensing? – A geospatial analysists dream! In my understanding, it is a subset of GIS, with a varied range of applications and uses. In short, sensors are used to collect information about the earth’s surface and then this can be used for analysis. The information is detected by measuring the differing types of Eledtromagnetic radiation and assessing from such what an object/landscape is. For instance, sensors like SAR and LiDAR have the capacity to detect differences in buildings; i.e. made of tin / made of concrete. They have even been used in mapping informal settlements. Sensors can be active or passive. This, in basic terms, tells you how they collect the information, by natural means or emitting their own source. The ability to distinguish an object or phenomena is known by its spectral signature.\nThere are many types of sensors, ranging from orbiting space or being able to fit in your pocket (for instance, some iphones have a lidar sensor)! Of course the range of sensors will not collect the same information. The pictures below shows the correspondence of waves and the features inferred (left) as well as some sensors to capture them (right).\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nWarning: package 'cowplot' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Penetration (left), B1 band (right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      \n         hello\n                \n  \n  \n      \n        2  Summary",

This will provide me with a clear north, south, east and west of the location that the plane crashed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this I had used Landsat level 2, which would include the surface reflectance and temperature. Looking at the two images from the usgs, I have one landsat 8 and one landsat 9, the temporal differences between the images are shown below. As you can see the images looks different to each other, this shows that time and cloud cover will influenced my analysis if this is not accounted for. As expected, the vegetation in the area of the crash site will be very very sparse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, I attempted to utilise NDGI, the glacier index, this did not show me what I was expected, I used the code below to calculate this for Landsat 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntexture of the ground would be important to view the challenge of traversing through the Andean mountains. By looking at the GLCM we understand how the area is characterised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy changing the original image data into principle components, PCA helps make it easier to see the differences between types of land or geological features, for use of recognition and categorisation.
