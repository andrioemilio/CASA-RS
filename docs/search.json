I love to travel, collect vintage instant cameras and spend time with my dog. I hope you get a feel of my humour within this learning diary. I took the informalness very literal and wanted to explore my own interests and apply this to remote sensing without gatekeeping if they would be the best examples to use. In my working life so far i’ve found it difficult to cover topics that I find interesting and this was one of the reasons I pursued masters at CASA.\nMy initial thought was to frame this diary in a manner like I saw of the punk zines in the movie shirkers I even made a front cover. After the realisation that i’ve never made a zine before I veered away from the idea. But within the first weeks it was all roads lead to Sputnik (the name of my zine), it was the first satellite in orbit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and Cherry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first born\n\n\n\n\n!",

    "text": "So what is remote sensing? – A geospatial analyists dream!\nA subset of GIS, with a varied range of applications and uses. In short, sensors are used to collect information about the earth’s surface and then this can be used for analysis. The information is detected by measuring the differing types of Eledtromagnetic radiation and assessing from such what an object/landscape is. For instance, sensors like SAR and LiDAR have the capacity to detect differences in buildings (Nordin et al, 2019); useful in instances such as disaster management (Kim et al, 2023) by detecting the damage of the building and material involved. Sensors can be active or passive. This, in basic terms, this tells how the sensor collecs information, by natural means (passive) or emitting their own source (active). There are many types of sensors, ranging from orbiting space or being able to fit in your pocket (for instance, some iphones have a lidar sensor)! Of course the range of sensors will not collect the same information. The pictures below shows the correspondence of waves as well as some sensors to capture them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther on to this, resolution plays a big role in what is captured for analysis, there are often some trade offs from one resolution type to another. The four main types are as followed:\n\nSpectral, the number of bands the sensor records\nSpatial, the size of each pixel\nTemporal, how frequent the area will revisit\nRadiometric, the range of reflectance",

Well, probably not, the extent of light absorbed and scattered by water is significantly more than by air. Still, there is growing analysis of using remote sensing for marine biological observation. The operational Land Imager did exactly this, who knew remote sensors could produce something so beautiful?\n\n\n\n\nblooms of phytoplankton of the Chukchi Sea acquired on June 18, 2018, by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8\n\n\n\nAs shown below, sensors have been used to monitor the biological and physical attributes of marine areas including sea surface height, sea surface temperature, salinityand chlorophyll (Kavanaugh, 2021).\n\n\n\n\nSatellite remote sensing and the Marine Biological Observation Network.\n\n\n\nNew Orleans\nLets get Jazzy! Following from the lecture material and theory, it was time to put the wheels in motion. In my mind while traversing through the seminar it seemed as though Landsat and Sentinel were in a battle of attrition, Sentinel would say “well I have SNAP specially built for me” and Landsat would retort “well I have been here longer” .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some listing points on both Landsat & Sentinel\nSentinel\n\nPart of Corpenicus programme, initiated earlys 2000’s\nFreely accessible\nSoftware in snap built for use\nAlways been freely accessible\n\nLandsat\n\nBegan in early 1960\nManaged by NASA\nFreely accessible since 2008\nLongest running earth observation\n\nI was able to pull Landsat and Sentinel information of New Orleans.I then selected points of interest of Urban, Water & Green to witness in R if I could compute the differences. First I need to be adjusted my data by resampling/masking to the same resolution.\nSnap allowed me to view the data side by side, they look different, I think sentinel (left) looks prettier, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral signatures\nThe ability to distinguish an object or phenomena is known by its spectral signature.\nToying with the bands shows you different information. For example, ands 3, 4 & 8 show false colour composite, showing soil and land resources. In my case, I stuck to bands 2, 3 & 4, a true colour image.",

    "text": "Reflection\nI recognised early on in both lecture and seminar that the key to be able to analyse an area correctively its necessary to check work and validate if the information you are using is correct.\nSNAP was so time consuming and if I made a mistake or downloaded the wrong file it took even longer! I noticed far too late into my analysis that different sensors detect longer/shorter waves, together with the fact that classification of bands are not consistent from sensor to sensor (Landsat vs Sentinel); in the section above I purposely omitted some information that skewed my results of the New Orleans analysis. The R analysis plots only show Landsat data, it shows the expected levels plotted for green urban and water, cross-validated with the seminar example. Though, with sentinel data an issue arose that I was unable to solve I assume this is from the different band clarification or resolution. I then traced my steps backwards and loaded my sentinel and Landsat data into QGIS, and it although I thought I altered the resolution to the same for Landsat and sentinel, it appears that this isn’t the case (and also the angle of my Landsat data is 45 degrees than the sentinel. As such, I am thinking that the vector location coordinates that I used in my R studio analysis may have altered these.\nI subject my error in results to the fact that I am not the best person to keep handle of my reference points in the work that I do so traceback is difficult. Throughout this course I have been learning that recording what you do step-by-step is vital with any project that handles large quantities of data. I have found that SNAP may be akin to diving at 50 ft podium without mastering the how to dive at all. In fact, I think a few of us struggles in the seminar so I am not alone! However, the insights the software gives is invaluable and necessary analysis as noted too, but I do wonder of the barriers to entry for such a software with its difficulty to learn and how you would even come about it. Nonetheless, Bikini bottom may be found soon (Sun et al, 2021)! thats me wishful thinking",

    "text": "Application\nBefore this, I would like to discuss two cases in which enhancement were made and assess the effectiveness between them.\n\nApplication in Mountainous Environments\n\nFirst is a paper discussing the use of remote sensing in monitoring land use and land cover as well as climate changes in mountainous ecosystems (Jombo, et al 2023). They do this by ratios with NDVI and NDSI (snow index) as well as using the quickbird sensor. What I found from this is that they attached a plethora of enhancements with many datasets from different sensors (see table below). This seems quite convoluted to me but monitoring cases such as climate change require robust processes with strong methodologies. My initial suggestion when reading the introduction would be to perform PCA and then classify areas that are of the most concern to detail into reasons why patterns could be detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Workshop Organized by EURAC in the Core of the Alps\n\nSecondly a workship that discusses the difficulties of applying remote sensing techniques to mountainous environments (Zebisch et a, 2007). I struggle with my understanding of this as seen above, there are plentyful of datasets and enhancements. It mentions that it may be time consuming and unreproducable, but software such as GEE shortens down this process greatly. I do agree with the proposed methodologies and unaccounted risks being an issue to solve. Though, this could still be applied based upon previous methodologies in analysis such as air quality, land use & climate change. A lasting note to this is that the paper was published in 2007, before google earth engine really shot in the sky. GEE has greatly improved the ease of creating reproducible spatial metrics, the chart below shows the impact of remote sensing to recent times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndean Mounatins\nAfter inputting the coordinates of the crash site, I sought to find more information about the terrain using Landsat imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, to view the terrains of what the survivors were faced with in whatever direction they would go, I merged two landsat raster images. This provides me with an image containing a clear north, south, east and west of the location that the plane crashed. For this I had used Landsat level 2, which would include the surface reflectance and temperature. Looking at the two images from USGS, I have one landsat 8 and one landsat 9, the temporal differences between the images are shown below. As you can see the images looks different to each other, this shows that time and cloud cover will influenced my analysis if this is not accounted for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, the vegetation in the area of the crash site will be very very sparse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, I attempted to utilise NDGI, the glacier index to identify and monitor glacial and ice regions. This did not show me what I was expecting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture of the ground would be important to view the challenge of traversing through the Andean mountains. By looking at the GLCM we understand how the area is characterised. I used the contrast to show the differences in the mountain region where in the crash happened. This shows how diverse the regions mountains are in height and stature. I dont know how that many survived.",

    "text": "Reflection\nI found this weeks diary entry very computationally difficult, so agian I attempted to entertain myself with this topic. It did however come with many challenges. The ideas I had seemed to overrun my computer or the output be not as expected for a mountainous snowy region. I had an idea to use the rayshader library to create a video such as the one shown below so it can be applied to enhance the visualization of the terrain from satellite imagery making it easier to interpret surface features (and also very cool). This again was too computational for my computer but would show the vast terrain of the mountains that the survivors had to traverse. Still, I found this weeks entry the most interesting by far, the possibilities within enhancements and corrections for seem endless. I am very keen to use google earth engine now to speed up the processes of achieving results such as the one above!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my career before starting this master I worked upon the railway where I was tasked to map the whole of the Kent and Sussex track. For this I had just used data on where the track sat on the railway as well as a customised FME transformer. It was used to pinpoint issues within vegetation upon the track (not as simple as tree is overlaying it needs to chopped down, some are protected!) so this technology I feel could be utilised in monitoring vegetation instead of routine surveying. I wonder whether remote sensing technology has the ability yet to detect the specific type of vegetation as I assume different types of vegetation reflect NIR differently.",

    "text": "This weeek I returned to my hometown of Doncaster.\n\n\n\n\nthe only thing to do here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand spend time with Frankie\n\n\n\nMe and my father don’t speak much other than him asking me if I had watched the football. Although since watching society of the snow and him being Latin American I just had to pester him about what the news was like at the time of the crash. After a few mumbles of nothing he said that he didnt really remember the news but one of his favourite holidays as a child was when he went to Peru and surfed the sand dunes. I cant imagine my dad ever doing something that sounds fun - hes a golfer, but I did research into it and it sounds great. However, what is not so fortunate for the populations around these areas is the risk of desertification, which introduces this weeks diary entry on policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiura is located in the northwestern part of Peru. It is one of the most diverse areas in the country. It consits of coastal to high mountains. This gives it a very unique landscape with many exotic and unique species. The areas also is very arid in some areas. Although the landscape in Piura is beautiful, the area has been experiencing desertifcation and risks losing its unique ecosystem, making the temperature even more arid and ultimately the loss of population due to the livelihoods being impacted. The region is also known to suffer from water scarcity and the el nino phenomenon an irregular occurrence of drought which further exemplifies desertification risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fight against this the national action plan for the fight against desertification (PAN Peru) was established. This sets objectives in sustainable land management for the region. Here is a short summary of the key objectives:\n\nSustainable Land Management: Promoting practices that help maintain the health of the land, improve agricultural productivity, and support biodiversity conservation.\nWater Resource Management: Being wary of water usage and improving access to water for arid environments.\nEcosystem Restoration: Implementing reforestation projects as well as rehabilitating degraded lands to increase ecological strength.\nClimate Change Adaptation: Strategies to help communities and adapting to the impacts of climate change.\nParticipation: Engaging local communities in the planning and implementation of projects\nPolicy Integration and Governance: Ensuring that other policies have strong and thorough research into integrating desertification and land degradation. An example of this is the Peru’s National Forest Conservation Program for Climate Change Mitigation (PNCB) a key policy for sustainable management and combating desertification.\n\nBelow are some initiatives taken to combat this in the Piura Region\n\nDry Forest of the Northern Coast of Peru project:\n\nAddressing challenges such as deforestation and climate change. Impacts are to emphasise conservation of endangered species and promotion of land use practices. They use research, monitoring community engagement and capacity building. to enhance understanding and stewardship of the ecosystems and provide ways in which local communities can not damage any further.\n\nReforest’Action:\n\nTree planting of 500,000 trees across Huarmaca and Pacaipampa districts since January 2020. Includes local community engagement and educating on sustainable agricultural; practices Restore forest cover, combat soil erosion, and rejuvenate degraded lands\n\nCutivalú radio station: Radio station that discusses current issues within the region. Keeps people informed about environmental issues concerning Piura\n\nOne of the key issues highlighted by Guevara (2015) is the need to take account for the vegetation and harvesting of in the area. A proposal towards this is that the area should ‘create special types of stockbreeding, agriculture and forest industries which would adapt to the characteristics of arid zones and promote those species which have already become adapted to aridity’. Though there have been improvements in the areas, especially attempting to change the culture of recycling and water usage, as well as initiatives. Yet, there are still few data sources on the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is apparent in the policy making is the monitoring of species and effects of desertification and topics that may lead to such. Though, with many individual initiatives by NGO’s the national & local government, some of this information could be falsified, forgotten or not interpretable together with other results. An example of this is given within the sahel region and their attempts to handle the great green wall initiative.\nNDVI for vegetation monitoring\nA way to witness the effects of these projects is by vegetation monitoring with NDVI. Simply put, As healthy vegetation absorbs most of the visible light and reflects a significant portion of the near-infrared (NIR) light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the use of remote sesnors that provide many datasets to monitor vegetation, this offers:\n\nConsistency and Comparability: providing a time-series, standardised way to compare vegetation health.\nAccessibility: Monitoring will be vast and able to access inaccessible areas.\nTemporal Analysis: Enables the analysis of vegetation dynamics, seasonal changes, and long-term trends (counting for the el nino phenomenon).\n\nWith this knowledge an application could be built to measure the successes of the implementations of sustainable management and initiatives with the use of Landsat imagery and NDVI analysis to track the vegetation changes. An example using this for desertification is the Sahel region of Africa. Where Landsat imagery has been used to monitor vegetation changes over time. This involved using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analyses to assess vegetation health and coverage, identifying areas of degradation and improvement. There have been similar cases within this\nAlthough this sounds like a great solution to me. I recognise the stagnentness of governments to approve such remote sensing applications to the forefront of policy in monitoring sustainable environments. Need is publicised by the likes of Setta (2023) towards the effectiveness of this, yet, requires ongoing analysis and complex model creation and tweaking that may be considered as over-capacity and even distract from the root issue instead of aiding (Dubovik et al, 2021).\nReflection\nThis entry allowed me to foresee the potential challenges and just how hard it may be to centre remote sensing around policy decisions. First all of, the data must be explicitly ready for analysis and be understood by the policy makers. With complex methodologies this is a challenge to do. As well as this, the model must be changed and involve many different factors, you cant just say x is cause y or that y is bad because x is showing this if a factor is missing. Another issue I think is relevant especially in cities and cultures such as Piura is if the remote sensing technique would actually help at all.\nIt is known that one of the main reasons for desertification risk in the region is bad agricultural practices, remote sensing cannot stop this, just monitor the effects of change that governments implement. Instead, I see remote sensing being used in tandem with policy to assess the effectiveness of efforts.\nLastly, this area within remote sensing is the furthest from the knowledge that I currently have. I have previous experience working within government owned institutions such as the railway and education and know of the issues it takes for even the most simplest of policies to get approved. For this reason I can understand how something that is quite novel in solving an issue will take some time to catch steam and take off upon the correct tracks.\n~~ I may have to sand surf in Piura now ~~\n\n\n\n      \n         Issue 3 - Deep in the Andes\n                \n  \n  \n      \n        Issue 5 - Home truths",

    "text": "Application\nBelfast\nTime to explore the hometown of Paddy Close (my grandfather). To do this I loaded in L-8 level 2 collection 2 images from Landsat. I first of all used the coordinates of the street that my grandfather was born and found a GADM shapefile to correspond with clipping the area of interest, Belfast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter adjusting cloud cover and clipping I then sought to do a few tidbits of analysis. Adjusting the cloud cover and clipping it to the shapefile of Belfast is imperative to actually see the area as it can be overshadowed by the clouds as well as giving the clear area of study\nI have also performed NDVI of the area which tells of the health and density of vegetation in an area. It does this by measures the difference of near infrarer light as vegetation strongly reflects this. And so, more green indicates denser vegetation.\nIt shows nothing much of what you would expect; less vegetation near the centre more on the outskirts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GLCM of Belfast I found particularly interesting to see, as the contrast between neighbouring pixels as a measure of the texture shows that East and West Belfast have significant spikes in change, signifying that there is a dense urban environment in the two and that North and South Belfast isn’t as dense. This supports the two cultures in the city, thsoe of the West & East.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore applications\nI’ve just discovered the tip of the iceburg (or Andean mountain) with application in google earth engine.\nFor this section i’ll briefly discuss some case studies from the GEE website.\n\nGlobal Forest Cover Change - Land study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarth Engine was used to examine global tree cover, resulting in a comprehensive study Covering nearly all of Earth’s land except Antarctica and some Arctic islands.\n\nThe Map of Life - The impact of environmental changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Map of Life project has created an interactive map that enables conservationists to examine habitat ranges and evaluate the conservation status of individual species.\n\nMalaria Risk Mapping - Potential outbreaks predictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Health Group San Francisco used Earth Engine for malaria risk mapping to forecast outbreaks.\nAs seen from the examples there are a plethora of uses in google earth engine, some even offer the code so you can apply these to your own interests for analysis. In fact 90 journals published articles on GEE in a 2 year period since January 2020. In these papers most revolve around areas within remote sensing of the environment. What I did find poignant however is the lack of studies based within less developed nations as this is such an ideal tool to provide an analysis in areas such as heat and flood risk as well as assessing the health of local vegetation. The map below shows this, with a breakdown of application of GEE by each country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the most popular data recorded from this are Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. These make sense due to the already applicability used in previous studies.\nAs well as this, it offers less of a barrier to entry due to its easy accessibility to use. I can see why as there’s less of a need for SNAP or to search, find & process data in R.\nReflections\nI found GEE a joy to utilise but again seemed like a hurdle to handle to get control of. It reminded me of when I started my career in analysis and got handed a huge on powerBI and was asked to produce something by the end of the week. I also had issues in clipping. Basically, my initial clip was just the area in where my grandfather was born so when I applied NDVI to it the resolution was not high enough to provide any difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside this and after the entry on the Andean mountains I was curious to explore other ratios and textures. Some that I feel that could be applied to the case in Belfast is the NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) that would show built-up areas from natural landscapes and weather there is differences in east to west. As well as using contrast in GLCM which would show presence of distincts boundaries. Further into this, perhaps another method/type of inmagery could be used to tell if the buildings are structurally and materially different from east to west Belfast. I found that this can be achieved within a combination of spectral bands and texture features to show the form of contructional materials, paint or rood colours!\nYou may be thinking why did I stop at GLCM and not move on to some PCA, I attempted this in engine using the classes example but recieved around 90 layers. I didnt implement this into the application section as I was unsure if I did a line of code wrong implementing this or if most variations were just located in some of the first instences of PCA (shown below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA1\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA2\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA3\n\n\n\n\nI also found it difficult to think of a way to discuss the application, this is why it was based upon the cases provided by them to show what the engine is capable of.\nOther than that I can see myself toying around with google earth engine from even in my day to day life. I dont think its a talent I can whip out at parties however.\nOne thing that I think is very important within google earth engines landscape is the consideration personal data inputted, it runs the risk of vulnerable information being shown to the masses.",

    "text": "OBIC\nThe way I understood OBIA is that it thinks in objects and not pixels. The most important thing I consider to understand it is that it is a two step process.\n\nSegmentation\nClassification\n\nSegmentation\nIt segments small, similar neighbouring pixels into a vector. Segmentation will automatically do this and display it clearly. Its almost as if what your eyes would see looking out of a helicopter (large green space, building look merged into one). It segments them together in a number of ways (you can even give the model rules on how to).\nIn a scary (or exciting) turn events, i’d say OBIA thinks like a human more so than a computer. A computer would not be able to recognise a lake from a river, but your eyes can!\nThis is when image classification plays gets involved usually; for a computer to finally distinguish a lake from a river. Though traditional cases will tend to assign a land cover class per pixel whereas OBIA does not.\nSegmentation helps you recognise groups forming from pixels. As sensor resolutions are getting stronger this is only growing in importance. Two of the most common segmentation techniques are k-means and SNIC.\n\nK-means Groups data samples into K clusters, each sample belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. It clusters data interactively by finding the densest regions (clusters) in a feature space.\nSimple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC), a novel approach. ‘Our algorithm clusters pixels without the use of the kmeans iterations to update the centroids, we update the centroids in a single iteration.’ (Achanta et al, 2017) It assigns pixels to points through distance color and co-ordinates, representing normalised spatial and color distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK-means\n\n\n\n\n\nSNIC\n\n\n\n\nTheres an argument to use both approaches and I suppose this is dependant on the model you use I still dont particulary understand the methodologies behind these but within remote sensing I’d sat a SNIC approach may have more uses as SNIC focuses on grouping pixels based on spatial proximity and pixel similarity (distance color and co-ordinates), whereas K-mean seperates data into clusters based on feature similarity without considering the spatial relationships.\nClassification\nAfter that it is then time to classify. With segmentation, a sample can be taken with features to train the classification model and then later test against it. An example of a classification technique assigning landcover classes with CART.\nBelow shows the process of OBIA, confusing but step 2 & 3 are the real steps to take into consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness\nAs data becomes more rich and detailed, tools like OBIA are imperative to help automate and solve issues in a contemporary way. It offers increased accuracy for classification purposes and speeds up the process for max production. It also utilises human input in the way that it can be trained to understand situations such as when a group of trees, grass and water is found near dense house it is likely to be a city park, as well as maximinising use of sensors with higher resolution for analysis. However, Some issues that may arise from this is that OBIA creation seems to be a lengthy process, to understand and many things may go wrong with having the wrong segmentation or classifier, as well as this, fine tuning the model to particular interest to the spatial area may be necessary, coupled with the high computational cost it takes. Another potential problem is that in some cases such as mapping informal settlements the OBIA has not been successful as the material in the informal settlements is the same as",

    "text": "Applications\nAn application of OBIA can be seen with data from the National Agriculture Imagery program (NAIP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe segment used the SNIC algorithm, dividing into similar neighbouring pixels areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this samples were taken to train the data in 5 classes of Urban, Watrer, Agriculture, Forestry and Grass. The samples offer the characteristics to be chosen and personalised for feature selection to then classify data. Some examples of features that can be taken are Spectral bands NDVI as well as GLCM features such as contrast and homogeneity. Finally, classification can be utilised to predict the land us and land cover of the area. For this example random forest was chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough OBIA has been used and shown significant accuracies of PBIA in wetland areas, it is not completely triumphant. In fact when applying both methods to arctic wetlands no significant accuracies were detected and results had vague differences. Still with the use of GEE and incorporating novel EO features unexplored results were found that had shown information of wetland coverages and types at a Pan-Arctic scale at a greater scale. Especially useful in land surface and climate modelling.",

    "text": "Reflections\nThis is part of remote sensing that it took a long time to get my head around. The process seems to be convoluted and finding practical work in GEE seemed difficult. Although I can understand the use of this method as there is a lot of data at hand and machine learning can be used for automated outputs. When I started this module I found interest in the fact that remote sensing is used to explore the earth that is unaccessible to humans, with methods like this it is quite amazing to judge the human effects to areas (such as contribution to climate change) with OBIC that are now impacting lands in Antartica.\nTo help make sense of the topics this week I looked at what these are used for in industry. For instance, precision agriculture, where high-resolution satellite images are segmented into objects representing individual crop fields using OBIA. Deep learning models have then been used analyse these objects to classify crop types, assess health, and predict yields. Although, like much that is covered in this week its not very simple as this requires to ‘investigate how CNN models should use OBIA outputs for feature extraction and classification of remotely sensed images’ (Azeez et al, 2002). Analysis such as this, assessing ANN and OBIA together, is something that seems very powerful but at the same time very convoluted as they both require a complex understanding of the issue at hand. It makes me wonder if and when technology advances if these methods will then combine (much of like how OBIC combines segmentation and classification).",

    "text": "Urban Heat Island\nWhy is remote sensing temperature of importance? Temperature is one of the most important aspects in remote sensing, it can be used to monitor plant water stress, heat island effects and land cover change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban Heat islands\n\nUrban Heat islands are the occurrence of higher temperatures in urbanised areas compares rural, it can lead to discomfort higher energy consumption and aggravated pollution. Using thermal sensors therefore allows to recognise the most problematic areas.\nAn example of this within policy is the Mayor of Londons encouragement in the design of spaces to avoid excessive heat generation. A GEE application involving data that collects thermal heat can be applied to assess if the policy is working!\nMany sensors are used to explore this phenomenon such as the Thematic Mapper, MODIS, Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer and Prototype HyspIRI Thermal Infrared Radiometer. So I’ll be exploring a new sensor today withing GEE which is the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS captures data in 36 spectral bands ranging from visible to thermal infrared at varying spatial resolutions (from 250m to 1km). This capability allows MODIS to provide detailed observations of temperature across the Earth’s surface. It also has a high temporal resolution, permitting its ability to capture daily images and therefore showing the ability of variation in temperature than other sensors such as Landsat. It does by both Terra and Aqua satellites containing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and then combines the two to provide a comprehensive view of the Earth.\nTo prove if urban heat islands is real (always the skeptic) I therefore used Tokyo as an example because I actually when I went. It uses Aqua and Terra to visualise temperature. Its clear to see, with Tokyo being one of the most densley populates cities in the world that urban heat island exists there. Veering out of the city, the heat reduces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle earth engine can also produce a time series to monitor the temperature, this can be compared yearly to track changes in heat in locations (kind of like what you can see with currency changes or covid-19 rates).",

Below is an explanation of some and there corresponding cases.\n\nCART\n\nPredicts the value of a target variable by analysing other matters. It then constructs a decision tree where each branch represents a decision based on the variables found and each leaf node provides a prediction for the target variable.\nIt starts with a training set as the root node, then divides into subsets using the most suitable attribute. This splitting continues until the tree reaches pure subsets or the predetermined maximum number of leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLANDFIRE EVC (Existing Vegetation Cover)\nThis uses classification and regression trees to create layers in google earth engine to create a ‘Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tool’.\nSome of the layers created include: Existing Vegetation Canopy Cover (EVC) and Existing Vegetation Type (EVT).\n\nRandom Forests\n\nUsed for classification and regression. It works by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random forests aim to improve upon the prediction accuracy of a single decision tree by reducing overfitting through averaging the results of many trees\nIrrMapper is an annual classification of irrigation status in the 11 Western United States made at Landsat scale (i.e., 30 m) using the Random Forest algorithm, covering years 1986 - present. The Iran-wide land cover map was generated by processing Sentinel imager, an object-based Random Forest classification method was trained by a large number of reference samples for 13 classes to generate the Iran-wide land cover map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Vector Machines\n\nSVM finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. Maximising the margin between the closest data points of different classes (support vectors), which together creates classification boundaries.\nThe World Settlement Footprint (WSF) 2015 outlines the extent of human settlements globally derived by means of 2014-2015 multitemporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 imagery. Different classification schemes based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are separately applied to the optical and radar temporal features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I noticed within searching GEE cases by specific methods for analysis is the widespread use of random forest algorithm. I struggled within this aspect as I head sought information that spoke of the most widespread methods involving SVM & CART too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless it showed me that researchers that use GEE must have an underpinning of the knowledge of these classification methods to justify which one is best fit for the analysis that they provide.",

    "text": "Application\nLC classification This research shows the capacity of google earth engine in using large scale remote sensing imagery for analysis. It examines how land surface temperatures and land cover changes in part influence the effects of an urban heat island. A key part of the study involved used google earth engine in developing a methodology for correlating changes in land surface temperature with alterations in land cover on a large scale.\nThey primarily used findings from Phoenix and this indicated that urbanisation significantly influences the magnitude of UHI effects, leading to notable increases in land surface temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as a map from google earth engine to show this, they produced a constant matrix to compare the changes in a 20 year period. It shows the baseline or starting temperatures associated with different land cover types and states how they have shifted due to urbanisation or land cover changes. From this, even in 1992, the higher land surface temperatures are located in the urbanised areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy take from this paper is that it shows that with a robust methodology you can effectively monitor the urban heat island phenomenon and shows the impact of urban expansion towards land cover changes in google earth engine.\nAlthough this doesnt come without challenges and debate within the creation of this to monitor urban heat island. Some challenges include the availability of the date and coverage of the satellite they decide to use. In their instance they used Landsat 8. As well as this, the classification of land cover can be hard to segment. Even seen in this report as land cover classification had changed from 1992 to 2012 (the analysis coverage dates). Furthermore, the type of classification was not stated within the paper which makes the paper difficult to replicate or use the framework to analyse the urban heat island effect in other cities. Without the data being reproducible their conclusion of the use urban heat island effects will not be able to be clarified by other research with the same methodology. This also leads to questioning of the methodology to account for the complex factors in causes the urban heat island phenomenon. This phenomonon is stated to require a complex methodology and not risk simplifying and failing to account for what the data presents. Causality is not causation!",
